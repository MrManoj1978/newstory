This is the chapter3.txt file, here we are again adding some
random text for testing purposes.

Here we learn what to do if say, you accidently mess up
or ruin a file in a project (maybe u fell asleep) and 
accidently saved it.

Well, in such a case, you can compare the saved file with
the previous file (the one you most likely will want to
revert back to) by using this command:

git diff chapter3.txt

Once you hit enter you will see the part that got deleted
(it appears in red) and it may show you the stuff you
entered when u saved it.

Now to undo the change, use the command:
git checkout chapter3.txt


Greetings earthlings, my name is Ploppleton Fizzleflop and
I hail from the hilariously named planet "Gloopblorpia." It's 
a world renowned for its bubbly swamps, fizzy waterfalls, 
and of course, its population of whimsical and clumsy creatures 
like myself, Ploppleton.
